# Biography

I am an (evolutionary) ecologist broadly interested in population and community dynamics.

Since 2014, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Owen Petchey. I study the effects and predictability of temperature increase on community structure and composition, using microbial ecosystems. To understand the dynamics of these systems, I perform mathematical and statistical modeling.

My background is in conservation biology (e.g. my Diploma thesis on dispersal and 
population dynamics of a endangered checkerspot butterfly in Portugal), but for my PhD with 
[Nicolas Schtickzelle](http://www.uclouvain.be/en-81772.html), I have shifted to microbial model systems of protists to address fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology.

I actively develop digital image and video-based techniques to automatically quantify individuals and their traits in the microbial model systems we use in our lab. Please checkout the [software](http://pennekampster.github.io/pennekampster/pages/software.html) section to see current and past projects.

Please get in touch if you are interested in my research and potential collaboration!
