# Biography

I am an (evolutionary) ecologist broadly interested in population and community dynamics. My background is in conservation biology, but for my PhD with [Nicolas Schtickzelle](https://www.nicolas-schtickzelle.net/), I have shifted to work on microbial model systems to address fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. My PhD was largely focused on the genetic and environmental drivers of movement and dispersal of _Tetrahymena thermophila_ ciliates.

Since 2014, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Owen Petchey at the University of Zurich, where I study the effects and predictability of temperature increase on community structure and composition. To understand the dynamics of communities, I conduct experiments with microbes and perform mathematical and statistical modeling. I also work with 

I develop digital image and video-based techniques to automatically quantify individuals and their traits in the microbial model systems we use in our lab.
