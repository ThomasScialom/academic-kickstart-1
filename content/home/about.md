# Biography
# 
I am an (evolutionary) ecologist broadly interested in how populations
and communities respond to global change.  I am currently a [group
leader](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/ecology/biotic_responses.html
) in the Department of Evolutionary biology and Environmental Studies,
University of Zurich

My background is in conservation biology, but for my PhD with [Nicolas
Schtickzelle](https://www.nicolas-schtickzelle.net/), I have shifted to
work on microbial model systems to address fundamental questions in
ecology and evolutionary biology. My PhD was largely focused on the
genetic and environmental drivers of movement and dispersal of
_Tetrahymena thermophila_ ciliates.

From 2014 to 2019, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [Owen
Petchey](https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/petchey_owen.html) 
on understanding the effects of warming on community structure and
composition, and the emerging field of ecological predictability.

I work at the interface of experiments and theory: I mostly collect data
on microbial model systems and perform mathematical and statistical
modeling. In the past (and hopefully in the future) I will work with
insects, a group I am particularly fond of!

To guide my research, I develop open source software, for instance, 
digital image and video-based techniques to automatically quantify
individuals and their traits.
